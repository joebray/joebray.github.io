                    <h1>Who is Britain’s worst train company?</h1>
                    <h2 class="lead">With more passengers using Britain's rail network every year, how many trains actually arrive on time? And are train companies coping with the millions of passenger journeys they provide?</h2>
                    <p>Figures released by Office of Rail Regulation suggest that Govia Thameslink were the worst Train Operating Company (TOC) for late and cancelled trains compared to planned services between 2016-17. Govia Thameslink operate the Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern franchises, which accounted for over 320m passenger journeys during the financial year.
Despite 26% of planned trains arriving late, Govia Thameslink Virgin Trains’ East and West Coast franchises have the highest percentage of significantly late services since 2010, along with the highest complaints rate in 2016-17. Between its two franchises, Virgin carries just 18% of Govia Thameslink’s 320m passengers, yet operates a higher percentage of late and cancelled trains.
The top performing companies were consistently MerseyRail, TfL, London Overground and c2c (which operates the Essex Thameside franchise between London and Essex).<p>
                    <h3>Who uses which TOC?</h3>
                    <p>To contextualise the data, we need to look at passenger numbers for each TOC and how many trains were planned in 2016.<p>
                    <img src="joebray.github.io/pass numbers vs trains planned 2017.jpeg" alt="passenger journeys treegraph"/>
                    <p>The data clearly shows that Govia Thameslink carry the most passenger journeys over the most trains planned. This would go some way to explain why the company has one of the lowest figures for trains arriving on time – it simply completes more journeys. 
In contrast, South Western and London Overground carry a large amount of passengers over 593,000 and 490,000 planned trains respectively. Yet, we will see that these companies both deliver more than 10% of their trains on time compared to Govia Thameslink.
Virgin’s TOC’s carry less passengers over less journeys, however we will see that their delivery is worse than many rivals who carry more passengers.
<p>
                    <h3>How many trains arrive on time?</h3>
                    <p>Arriving to your destination is all a passenger expects, but it appears that isn’t easy for some TOC’s.<p>
                    <img src="joebray.github.io/trains ontime by trains planned.jpeg" alt="trains ontime"/>
                    <p>In 2016-17, MerseyRail was the best performing TOC, with 95% of trains arriving on time – defined as within five minutes of schedule. TfL Rail, c2c and London Overground also performed highly with 94%.
In contrast, Virgin West Coast (80%), Transpennine Express (79%), CrossCountry (78%), Govia Thameslink (74%) and Virgin East Coast (72%) were the poorest performing TOC’s.
Govia Thameslink clearly provide more journeys, however passengers travelling with these companies do so with a 20-28% chance of arriving late.
<p>
                    <h3>What about trains arriving within ten minutes?</h3>
                    <p>While annoying, a train arriving within ten minutes is unlikely to disrupt many passengers. So do Virgin, Transpennine Express, CrossCountry, and Govia Thameslink perform better here?<p>
                    <img src="joebray.github.io/trains 10 mins v.2.jpeg" alt="trains ten minutes"/>
                    <p>In short, no. 
Cross Country are most improved from the group, with 89% of trains arriving within ten minutes – an increase of 11.5% from within five minutes. However, these companies remain the worst performing TOC’s for meeting schedule.
Once again, Merseyrail tops the list, with 98% of trains arriving within ten minutes.
<p>
                    <h3>Which companies have the worst delays?</h3>
                    <img src="joebray.github.io/Trains Arriving Significantly Late.jpeg" alt="trains significantly late"/>
                    <p>Virgin Trains East Coast clearly has the worst record for their trains arriving significantly late, closely followed by their West Coast relative. However, Virgin West Coast shows signs of improving since 2012-13, whereas the East Coast TOC has increased from 0.2% in 2014-15 to 0.36% of trains arriving significantly late in 2016-17.
Below Virgin, CrossCountry and TransPennine Express record higher percentages of significantly late trains than the majority of their competitors. However, it is worth stating that these four consistently higher TOC’s do operate over longer distances, which would provide more opportunity to accumulate delays.
<p>
                    <h3>Who cancels the most trains?</h3>
                    <p>Cancelled trains cause the most disruption for passengers, and Govia Thameslink are comfortably the worst TOC in this regard. <p>
                    <img src="joebray.github.io/trains cancelled versus planned 2017.jpeg" alt="trains planned v cancelled"/>
                    <p>With 8.7% of trains cancelled Govia Thameslink had the worst delivery in 2016-17. This is more than double the next worst TOC – TransPennine Express (4.1%) – which has significantly less trains planned. This equates to over 95,000 Govia Thameslink services.
Behind Transpennine Express is Virgin East Coast, which cancelled 3.2% of planned trains despite having the lowest number of services.
Northern Rail, despite having the second largest number of planned trains, only cancelled 1.7% of services, while Chiltern (1.5%) was the best operator for cancellations.
NOTE – Cancelled Trains refers to both full and part cancellations. A full cancellation is when the train failed to run entirely, ran less than 50 per cent of booked mileage, or arrive over 119 minutes late. A part cancellation is when the train terminated short of destination, started beyond origin, or fail to call/stop at a booked station.
<p>
                    <h3>So, which company gets the most complaints?</h3>
                    <p>We’ve established that Govia Thameslink carry the most passengers and operate the most services, so surely they will receive the most complaints from customers?<p>
                    <img src="joebray.github.io/complaints versus pass journeys 2017.jpeg" alt="journeys v complaints"/>
                    <p>Surprisingly, despite the worst record for cancelled trains, and low percentages for trains arriving on time, Govia Thameslink have one of the lowest complaints rates with 28 complaints per 100,000 journeys.
Instead, Virgin’s West and East Coast TOC’s stand out from their competitors with the most complaints. Virgin East Coast receive 108 complaints per 100,000 journeys while Virgin West Coast receive 154. As established, both companies carry under 40m passengers.
Once again, London Overground (2.2), TfL (2.9). and MerseyRail (9.9) return the best results.
<p>
                    <h3>How quickly are these complaints answered?</h3>
                    <p>The industry standard for answering complaints is within 20 working days.<p>
                    <img src="joebray.github.io/complaints 20 days.jpeg" alt="complaints 20 days"/>
                    <p>Looking at the yearly picture since 2010-11, Virgin West Coast stand out as the worst TOC for answering complaints within 20 working days. The company answered just 32% of complaints within the industry standard in 2013-4, and despite increasing that figure they dropped to 69% in 2016-17.
This was only higher than Arriva Wales (63%) and Great Western (61%) in 2016-17 – both of whom showed dramatic drops in response rate in the last two years. 
Another low performer was South Western, who dropped from 95% in 2012-13 to 50% and 48% for the following two years. In 2016-17, they only recorded 71%.
<p>
                    <h3>So which TOC’s deliver the best (and worst) service?</h3>
                    <p>Merseyrail, TfL Rail and London Overground consistently appear as the best TOC’s for punctuality, cancellations and complaints. These TOC’s are all city franchises which perhaps accounts for the low number of significant delays and cancellations – as services are frequent. Considering Northern Rail’s relatively high number of passenger numbers, their low cancellations and low complaints rate is impressive. 
For delivery of services, Govia Thameslink are the worst performing TOC. Although they carry the most passengers, they have the worst record for trains arriving on time, and the highest number of trains cancelled.
However, for quality of service, Virgin Train’s East and West Coast TOC’s have both got the worst complaints rate by some distance – coupled with Virgin West Coast’s poor record for answering these complaints within 20 days. Add to this their record of trains arriving significantly late since 2010, and both TOC’s arguably offer the worst experience.
